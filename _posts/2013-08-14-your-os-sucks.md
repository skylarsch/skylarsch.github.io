There has been a lot of talk about [Android being better](http://paulstamatiou.com/android-is-better) and [iOS being better for a use case](http://www.marco.org/2013/08/13/google-blindness).  When it's all said and done I tend to agree with Marco.  iOS fits my use case much better than Android.  Being my device being "open" is far less important to __ME__ than having smooth scrolling and a better selection of apps.

But that isn't to say I don't want Android to succeed.  Competition drives innovation.  I feel like iOS 7 is Apple's _crap! this Android thing is getting good, we better make some changes_ moment.  And I'm excited to see what is up Google's sleeve for the next version of Android.  That doesn't mean I'm going to run out and purchase the next Android powered device.  But there is room for two or three mobile OS' to exist in the market.

We all want something we love to get better, and if it takes competition for my preferred OS get better, then bring it.
