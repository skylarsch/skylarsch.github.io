I've been a Call of Duty fan since [Call of Duty: Big Red One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_2:_Big_Red_One).  But lately it seems the series has been slipping.  I think one of the major contributors to this is the aggressive 1 year release cycle.  With only 2 studios working on the franchise 2 years isn't a lot of time to produce a AAA title.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is [Sledgehammer Games'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer_Games) first foray into the COD franchise.  They lent a hand on Ghosts, but this is their game.  And boy does it look good.

I'm excited to see what having 3 studios on a 3 year cycle can do.
