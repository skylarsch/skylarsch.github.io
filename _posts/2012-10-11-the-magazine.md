I've been waiting impatiently to see Marco Arment's latest app.  And it's finally arrived.

[The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org).  Marco describes it on his blog...

> A modern iOS Newsstand publication for geeks like us thatâ€™s loosely about technology, but also gives tech writers a venue to explore other topics that like-minded geeks might find interesting.

I'm a huge fan of [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) and I can see The Magazine complementing it very smoothly.  The Magazine is one of those apps that I didn't know I needed but now that it's here, I can't live without it.  Not only is it a great idea, but it finally puts something into Newsstand.

If you're a fan of good design, good typography, and good writing, The Magazine will be for you.
