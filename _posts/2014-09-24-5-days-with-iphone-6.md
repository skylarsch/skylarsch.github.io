It’s been 5 days since I headed to my local Apple store and picked up my new iPhone 6.  Silver, 64GB, AT&T.  Like most things, I’ve got a few knee jerk reactions.

1. Not sure I’m in love with the size.  I’ve used my iPhone primarily 1 handed for the last 7 years.  It’s going to take some time to break that habit.

2. The battery is better.  Not earth shattering better, but better.  I haven’t seen the “20% battery remaining” alert yet, as I’m usually plugging in just under 30%.

3. The camera is amazing.

4. Apps that haven’t updated to support the new screen size look bad.  This isn’t the fault of the phone, scaling anything up usually won’t look great.

Overall I’m happy with the phone.  Sure, It’s not perfect.  Sure, I have some complaints.  But my 5s seems extremely thick, and the screen is far to small.  I think 4.7” will grow on me.  And I’m happy I didn’t go with an iPhone 6+.
