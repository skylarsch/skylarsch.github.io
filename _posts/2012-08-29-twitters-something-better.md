title: "Twitter's Something Better"

With all the dust the [Twitter API 1.1][1] has kicked up online over the last 13 days I know I'm not the first person to write about it.  The points have been exhausted, from "Twitter not caring about it's early adopters," to "Twitter just wants to show ads."  I'm sure most of you have already read all these opinions, and are either convinced that Twitter is "doing the right thing," or they are "wrong and you're going to join App.net."

I don't remember exactly when I stopped checking MySpace, but I'm fairly certain it was just about the time that I clicked the 'Sign Up' button on my Facebook invite email.  The reason I stopped checking MySpace, besides the horrible 'red text/black background' that everyone thought was the best thing ever, was I was given something better.  App.net was pitched as the "something better" for Twitter users.

Just to be clear, I'm on [App.net][app] and I plan on trying to use it.  Why haven't I?  Well, to be honest, Tweetbot doesn't support it.  Tweetbot lives on my iPhone dock with Messages, Mail, and Launch Center Pro.  It's always within thumbs reach, and all the people I care about connecting with use Twitter.  When I joined Facebook the switch was almost instantaneous because all of my friends were signing up.  App.net's user base is growing, and a large number of people that I want to follow are already using the service, or at least say they plan on using it.  So why haven't I given up on Twitter like I gave up on MySpace?  Because there are still people I want to connect with who aren't on App.net and the probably never will be.

That's the problem I have with App.net.  I have non-geek friends.  That's not to say non-geeks won't use App.net, but I've found it very difficult to pitch a $50 a year service that's just like Twitter.  The jump to Facebook was easy, all the "cool kids" were using it, and that's what everyone was taking about.  Being free didn't hurt either.

Twitter has become the same thing.  Everybody is using it.  From [taco trucks][tacos] to the [President of the United States][obama], everyone is associating their name with that '@' symbol.  But with such a wide user base they've forgotten an important business question, "how are we going to make money?"  Facebook has done it with ads, App.net is doing it with subscriptions but Twitter is in panic mode.

I imagine they came up with a 3 step process to get out of panic mode...

Step 1: "Control the user experience"

They plan on doing this by cutting out all the 3rd party apps.  They can't just revoke all 3rd party access to the API all at once, that would be too mean.  Instead, they'll just choke the life out of them.

Step 2: "Sell 'targeted' ads"

They're not selling ads per say, but interactions with "the brands [the user] cares about."  If I care about the brand I'll probably follow them on my own.  I don't need help.

Step 3: "Profit"

Twitter may still be the worlds most lovable bird, but if they continue in the direction of hostility towards the users it'll turn into another MySpace, but instead of rappers, it will be full of 'brands' and people telling me I've just won a free iPad!

I don't think there is a lifeboat yet, but when it comes, we'll know about it.  All the "cool kids" will be taking about it, and news stations will be telling us to follow them for the latest crap nobody cares about.  When the lifeboat comes along people will jump ship, because after all, who doesn't want to be where all the "cool kids" are?
