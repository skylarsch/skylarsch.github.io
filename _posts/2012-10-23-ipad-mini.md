Apple announced the new [iPad mini](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/) today.  No big surprise.

As a developer, I was worried about how the iPad mini would handle the current apps.  With the screen the same resolution it "just works."  The problem with that it tap targets.  One of the biggest problems with custom UI app's is many don't adhere to the minimum tap target size.

From the [Apple H.I.G.](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/Characteristics/Characteristics.html)

> Different iOS-based devices can have displays of different dimensions and resolutions, but in all devices the display affects the user experience in the same ways:

> - __44 x 44 points is the comfortable minimum size of a tappable UI element.__

It's not enough to assume the experience will be the same on the iPad mini.  TEST IT!  I can just about guarantee that the experience will be different.

The specs page online says it's got the dual-core A5.  I'm assuming it's the same one that powers the @2x display of the iPad (3).  I can't wait to see the performance of this thing.

Long story short, It's not the groundbreaking device it's big brother was, but it's cool and I can't wait to play with one.
