I've really only lived two places in my life: New Zealand, and Oklahoma, USA. This summer, I added California to the list. Actually, I've been living in Southern California all summer and have fallen in love with it. Sure, the 70-80 degree weather had something to do with that, but the truth is, it's just a great place.

I'm currently finishing up an internship here in Carlsbad, which is about 25 miles north of San Diego. I had already made the decision to stay out here when the company I'm interning with decided to keep me on. When they made the offer, I was thrilled. I'm getting to work on on an outstanding product with an incredible team of creative and talented people. I couldn't be happier.

With that said, I'm flying back to Oklahoma in the middle of August to see the family and collect some stuff. Then, I'll be returning to California the first weekend in September. It's been an exciting summer. Now, to discover what the next season of my life will hold!
