For the last few years I've been working under my own name.  We'll after a series of events I decided it was time to become official.  So I founded [OpenSky Development](http://openskydev.com).

It may seem somewhat of a clich√© to say "the sky is the limit."  OpenSky Development to means that there is a world of open possibilities and there is no limit to them.

It's been an adventure up until this point, and I plan on continuing doing what I love.  Creating awesome experiences in software, [creating and sharing](https://github.com/openskydev) the tools used to do that.  I'm very excited for what the future holds for the technology industry and hope to do my part in pushing it forward.

If you're interested in hiring me you can get in touch by emailing [contact@openskydev.com](mailto:contact@openskydev.com).  I stay busy but I'm always open to making room for a cool new project.
