There are tons of css libraries out there.  Seriously, just do a GitHub search.  With the success of Bootstrap many companies/people/designers are releasing their take on a css library into the wild.

I think it's great.  If you've got something, put it out there.  It isn't going to hurt anything.  But, if you have one of these css libraries please create a demo site/page/image, anything.  A readme is a great start but I don't want to download your project, and write html just to see what it looks like in a browser.  I would pass over the greatest css library in the world if there is no easy way for me to see what it's going to make my markup look like.

Keep creating, but while you're creating the next greatest css library, just throw together a simple demo page.  Thanks.
