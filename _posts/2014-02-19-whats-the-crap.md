[Facebook, lol.](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304914204579393452029288302)

> Facebook Inc. FB -2.67%  said it will pay $19 billion in a cash-and-stock deal to acquire smartphone-messaging app WhatsApp Inc.

That's ridiculous. 

Facebook has hit a point where it's "not the cool thing" anymore.  So they are panicking.  What happens when a huge tech company panics?  They start spending a crap ton of money on startups that haven't turned a profit.

WhatsApp will operate independently.  Facebook is just crapping themselves, trying to get the young user base under their banner.  And the sad thing, with the numbers WhatsApp is putting up, it'll probably help.
