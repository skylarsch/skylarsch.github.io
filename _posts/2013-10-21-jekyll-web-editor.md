When I first head about Jekyll I was skeptical.  There was something about using a blog editor without a "web" interface that I wasn't excited about.  I kept asking myself "what if you want to write something and you're no where near your computer with the repo on it?"  This was my go to excuse when I would think about moving my blog over to Jekyll or the like.

In reality this wasn't a problem.  It's been over 5 months since converting everything over to Jekyll and GitHub pages and I've never been away from my computer long enough that I couldn't publish something if I didn't want to.

But there has been an interesting development with GitHub pages.  They automatically build your site when you commit and push to master.  That allows for some something I think is really cool.  A web interface for creating/editing my Jekyll based website.  The computer I'm using doesn't need to have git installed or anything fancy.  Just a decent web browser and an internet connection.

How does this work?

When "save" the new file from GitHub's web editor then you're really committing to the repo.  This triggers GitHub pages build script and it rebuilds your site and publishes the changes.

Now your static blog has a web interface for editing content.
