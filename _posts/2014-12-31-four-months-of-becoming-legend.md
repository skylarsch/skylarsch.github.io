This year is drawing to a close.  And I can say without a doubt it has been a good one.

For me, the last 4 months have been especially great. [Destiny][0] has occupied 296 hours (12 days, 8 hours) of my time.  I’ve met some amazing people from all over the world.  Made great friends.  Tuesday night is a busy one for my raid group.

Some numbers: 

- I’ve racked up 77,843 kills.
- Cleared raids 23 times.  
- Ran 203 strikes.
- Killed 128 VIPs in patrol.
- Completed 187 public events.
- Won 197 games of Crucible.  With a K/D of 1.08
- 31961 kills with a Scout Rifle, 52% precision kills.
- 5146 kills with Sniper Rifles, 58% precision kills.
- 2828 kills with Heavy Machine Guns, 38% precision kills.
- Killed 38987 Fallen, with a K/D of 351.2
