I've never been a fan of the _new years resolution_.  I have always believed that if I wanted to do something I shouldn't have to wait until January 1st to do that thing.  Just start when ready.

That said, here's my _new years resolution_.  I will ship 1 thing a month. It may be an update to an existing application, or a new product.  Platform doesn't matter, I just want to ship 1 thing a month.  They may not always be polished, but they will be products.

My biggest struggle is when I work on something, I'll do all the fun challenging bits, get them sorted out then abandon the project forever.  Seriously by projects folder if FULL of junk that I have abandoned.

Some of these include.

- A blogging service. (Web)
- A chat app. (iOS/Mac/Web)
- A XKCD browser.  (iOS)
- A notes app with inline markdown. (iOS)
- A spades card game engine.  (iOS/Mac)
- 2 Tower Defense game engines. (iOS/Mac)
- An iOS stats service. (Rails)

And that's not counting the projects that haven't even begun to take a shape.

Seriously, it's a waistland in that folder.  But, I'm going to change that.  I have a few ideas to get me started, but I'm going to shoot for 1 thing a month.
