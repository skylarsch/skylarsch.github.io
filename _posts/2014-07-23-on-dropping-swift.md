Last night I made a decision to rewrite a side project in Objective-C.  It was originally written in Swift, and the decision didn't come lightly.  

It's a really cool project and I've got some awesome collaborators.  I'm hoping it can turn into a full blown product someday.  Earn us some money on the side, and generally make peoples lives better.  But with that comes the need to continue active development.  Adding features and fixing bugs.  While I love Swift, I'm not good enough with it to build a full long term project with it.

This decision was spurred on by looking at some of my old Objective-C code.  Not the awful stuff I wrote last week, but the truly awful stuff I wrote years ago.  Granted the project hadn't been touched in a few years, but it was riddled with bad decisions.  I couldn't belive how bad it was.

I don't want to have that experience every time I have to open up this project.  In the future when I'm more familiar with Swift I may drop some of it into the project.  But for now, I'm going to set down the shiny new nail gun, and pickup the trusty old hammer.

I've got a few smaller project I'm still working on in Swift.  These are the projects I'm going to be using to get better.
