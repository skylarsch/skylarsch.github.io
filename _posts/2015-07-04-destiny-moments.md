If you're not aware I'm a huge Destiny fan.  And when you play a game as much as I play Destiny you start to notice some things that may not work as well as they should.

One is the lag compensation in PvP.  A lot of FPS games seem to punish people with bad connections, but Destiny seems to reward them.  What do I mean by that?

God Mode for the red bar...

(I think that was a trade.)

Or just terrible spawn logic.

But even with all that, moments like this one keep me coming back for more.
