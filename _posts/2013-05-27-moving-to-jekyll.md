I've been blogging for years.  Now, when I say years, I don't mean that I've been consistently blogging for all those year.  It all started for me when I graduated High School.  It was a warm summers day in Oklahoma and I wanted to work on something.  At the time I had never written a single line of code or even knew what HTML was for that matter.  I explored a few options for starting a blog and finally settled on Blogger.

That first blog was terrible.  If I remember correctly, it was red text on a black background.  A great combination if you want to piss of everyone who looks at it.  I sucked at writing, not that I'm much better now.  I just brain dumped into that text input box.  I had one reader, thanks Mom.  But it was a good outlet to let me voice my opinions.  It went reasonably well for the summer and into my first year of school.

When I dropped out of college, for the first time, and went to work I was on the road a lot.  I began writing more, posting pictures from my travels, still into that crapy red text black background blog. That fell off when I went to work of an electronics company you've heard of.  They didn't want me taking about working there and that's what I was used to writing about.  Near the end of my time there, I got into web development and I decided that it was time to start another blog.  Enter Wordpress.

Wordpress powered my "technology company you've heard of blog" for about a year.  I only posted about once a month and it wasn't very good, but I was happy with it.  Once I started "programing" I decided to write my own blogging engine.  I began building one in PHP.  I had no idea how dumb of an idea it was at the time, and I was new to programing so it was a great learning experience.  It wasn't anything fancy but it was mine.

I began writing again and quite enjoyed the experience.  It was fun and I could do some cool things running my own platform.  It evolved over the year, and was completely rewritten at least twice.  After a while I got tired of maintaining it and considered moving back to Wordpress.  Someone recommended I try Tumblr, so I gave that a whirl.  Tumblr is a great service, and I still recommend it to anyone who just want to "put things online."  But the itch was still there to have something of my own.

I was beginning to pay closer attention to the development scene, and all I was hearing was how awesome Ruby on Rails was.  I decided to give it a try, but I needed a project.  That's when I decided to create my own blog again.  It was slow going, but eventually I learned enough Rails to get something out the door.  Just like my first PHP blog, it was bad, but it was mine.  I hacked on that for a few year.  In fact I deployed a few changes to it just a week ago.  Sure it was rewritten more than the PHP site, but that's what I do.  I hack on thing and try to make them better.

It was a great solution.  Easy to iterate on.  I had complete control, and it was great place to try out new things.  But I didn't want to pay Heroku money to keep it spun up all the time, and I'm a firm believer that having to wait 10 seconds for a page to load is unacceptable.  I looked at deploying to EC2 or something like it, but it just seemed like to much hassle to get it up and running on a VM.

This weekend I decided it was time to do something about the blog.  I know a few guys that use Octopress.  I took a look at that and decided I wanted something a little simpler.  Ocotpress is a Jekyll framework so I decided why not give Jekyll a shot.  I was in love.

Again I have complete control over my blog.  It's static so there are very little concerns about performance, and I can use GitHub to host it.  For me it's the very best solution possible.  I couldn't be happier.
