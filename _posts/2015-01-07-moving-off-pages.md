I’ve been hosting this blog on [GitHub Pages][0] since [March, 2013][1].  And with the change of the new year, I’ve decided it’s also time to change hosts.

I have nothing against Pages, and I think it’s still the easiest way to host a Jekyll site.  But I’m a tinker at heart and the easy way isn’t necessarily the fun way.  As of this moment skylarsch.com is running on it’s own VPS. Last night I got everything setup, and this morning I switched the DNS over.

My publishing workflow hasn’t changed at all.  I still push to a remote repo.  It receives the content and builds the site.  This is the same thing that occurred before, it just happening on my infrastructure instead of GitHubs.

So, here’s to a fantastic new setup, and a fantastic new year.
