[Material Design](http://www.polymer-project.org/components/paper-elements/demo.html)

I'm a fan of Google's new design _whatever they are calling it_.

Sure, some stuff it a bit heavy handed, but so was iOS 7's home screen animations.  Those got dialed back over time.

I think Google is on the right track.  Completion is good, and I can't wait to see what they do next.
