I've been a user of iTunes since I got the original click-wheel iPod.  I've seen them add TV shows, Movies, Apps, and Books.  Each iteration of the app added loads of functionality.  There hasn't been many "mind blowing" updates.

The application has gotten more and more bloated with each release.  Thinks like cover flow, while I can't figure out who would ever use them in real life, are great for demos.

Yesterday Apple released [iTunes 11](http://www.apple.com/itunes/).  It's a massive update.  Completely redesigned and rebuild from the ground up.  I can't decide if it feels more or less bloated.  It still does WAY more than a single application should, but with the new UI it doesn't seem like it's struggling to get everything into the interface.  Replacing lists with drop downs, and hiding the playlist bar until dragging an item makes it seem sleeker.  It'll take some getting used to, but once the new UI set's in I'm betting that it would be tough to go back to the old way.

The mini-player is actually usable now.  You can drop down a list of the upcoming items, and even remove them from the queue.  The one problem is trying to move it around the screen.  The "drag area" is a minefield of buttons and clicking and dragging on the buttons does nothing.  This is probably a bug and will hopefully fixed in a x.1 update.\

Overall, iTunes 11 is a great new take on an old app.
