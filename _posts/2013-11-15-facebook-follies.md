Not that long ago Facebook offered $3,000,000,000 for Snapchat.  Yep, that's 3 BILLION.  I have no idea what Facebook was thinking.  

They probably didn't do it for the technology.  The Poke app is essentially the exact same thing as Snapchat.  The only thing I can think of is users.  But are users in the "auto deleting photos/message app" space really worth $3B.  I don't think so.

And Snapchat turned it down.  I know if I was running a company that had no revenue stream, I'd jump at the chance to make some money and wash my hands of it.
