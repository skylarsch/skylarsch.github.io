title: "Destiny, Best Worst Game Ever"

I’ve been playing a lot of [Destiny][] lately. As I’m writing this my [profile][] has over 30 hours of playtime, 20,000+ kills across PvE and PvP.  I’ve cleared the raid, have full legendary armor, and weapons.  At this point I have done all the current content the game has to offer.  But I just can’t stop playing.

Destiny isn’t the first game I’ve spent countless hours in.  Oblivion and Skyrim have taken hundreds of hours of game time.  Minecraft… I don’t even want to know.  I’m thrilled with the hours I’ve spent playing Destiny, and can’t wait to play more.  But if you read reviews and community feedback, it would seem I am the only person who feels like this.

Common complaints include

- The story is short, confusing, and lacks character.

- The rewards system is broken.

- Master Rahool is a thieving jerk.

- PvP is unbalanced.

- The “endlessly explorable world” we were promised is rather tiny.

- The [RNG][] hate me/everyone.

And to be honest, I’ve complained about all those things.  Bungie has fixed some of the issues, and promised others will be in future updates.  It seems like they are listening to the community and actively trying to make their game the best it can be.

But, even with all those complaints, I can’t stop playing.  There are always seem to be people online, so it’s not just me.  My only conclusion; Destiny is the best worst game ever.
