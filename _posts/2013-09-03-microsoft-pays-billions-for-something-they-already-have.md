[Microsoft purchased Nokia this morning](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2013/Sep13/09-02AnnouncementPR.aspx) for EUR 5.44 Billion ([$7,157,408,000](https://www.google.com/search?q=EUR+5.44+to+usd&oq=EUR+5.44+to+usd&aqs=chrome..69i57.1362j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=EUR+5.44+billion+to+usd)).  That's a really big number.  But what did they really get?

Nokia is already exclusive Windows Phone, so they're not getting any _exclusive_ new hardware.  Nokia's distribution and supply chain could be worth some money, but not $7+ Billion.  Microsoft picks up Nokia's patents in the deal, so there's something.

I can only wonder if Nokia was about to fold, or switch to Android.  That would be a big panic moment for Microsoft.  Without a hardware manufacturer, Windows Phone would be in trouble.  Microsoft could try to make their own hardware, but with a shaky past in hardware, looking at you Xbox and your red ring, I see that as a hard problem to solve.  Not to mention the R&D time to bring a new smartphone to market.

I think Microsoft's purchase of Nokia is just a last ditch attempt to save a shrinking mobile market share.

I hope Microsoft can turn it around.  I'm not a fan of theirs but completion makes everyone better and in the end the consumer wins.
