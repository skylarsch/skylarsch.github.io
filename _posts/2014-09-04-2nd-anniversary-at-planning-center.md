Today was my 2nd anniversary working for [Planning Center][1].  In my two years here I’ve been a part of some amazing projects.

[Service iOS][2] Is our teams flagship app.  I began working on that not long after I started.  I’m extremely proud of it.

[Music Stand][3] allows musicians keep all of their sheet music in open place.  I started on Music Stand 3 after we got Services iOS into a feature stable state.  Again, I’m very proud of it.

I’ve also had the pleasure of open sourcing some of the things we use in our apps.  [MCTReachability][4] is our implementation of reachability.  It determines if a device is connected to the internet and if that connection is over WiFi or Cellular.  [PCOThemeKit][5] Is a plist based app theming library.  The UI can dynamically be themed based on plists that are changeable at runtime.  If you’ve seen “dark mode” in Music Stand, you’ve seen PCOThemeKit in action.

I’m very happy with my time at Planning Center.  Words like, “Best,” “Job,” and “Ever” are great descriptors for my time here.  Here’s to what the future holds.
