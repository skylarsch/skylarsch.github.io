iOS 6 Maps don't suck.  Eight times out of ten I find what I'm looking for and I arrive without driving into the ocean.  The reason they seem like they suck is because Google Maps are better.  Much better.

Sure, it's frustrating when I search for something, and I know it's at a location and it's not found or in the wrong place.  But all of this will get better with time.  Google Maps sucked when it started, but it has gotten better.

I'm not apologizing for Apple.  The maps are bad, but they're not as bad as they could be.  It takes time and lots of data to create a good map, and the best way to get data is to put the app into the wild on > ~200,000,000 devices.  Every time someone gets directions the dataset will get richer.

So calm down about the maps and complain about [Twitter](http://ashfurrow.com/twitter-cuts-ifttts-balls-off).
