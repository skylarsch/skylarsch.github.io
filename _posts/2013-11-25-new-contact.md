A while back [Jeremy Ricketts](http://jeremyricketts.com) gave an excellent talk at [Full Stack North County](http://fullstacktalks.com) on AB testing.  But his contact info at the end of the presentation really grabbed my interest.  It looked like his email address, but had different parts called out pointing to Twitter, GitHub, and web site.  I loved the idea and now many months later I've decided to try my hand at something similar.
