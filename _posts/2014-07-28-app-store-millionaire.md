Whenever I tell someone that I'm an iOS developer they usually think two things.

1.  I work for Apple.

	I think this is a greater misconception that geeks would assume.  It's usually not that hard to explain that I sell my apps in Apple's App Store.  They get that, but it's not the default thinking.

2.  I'm super rich.

	I can see how they think this.  All the news around app developers is usually about how many thousands of dollars they make every second.  But I assure you, that's not the case.
	
There are very few developers who are lucky enough to make obscene amounts of cash.  And even then, it's probably through some sort of consumable/can't progress in app purchase.

> To my knowledge, indie developers don’t publish the kind of numbers that you’ll find in this post. My sales records are none of your business, as the saying quite literally goes.

But Jared pulls back the covers and reveals the staggering truth that plagues so many paid app developers.  Launch sales are fantastic, followed by an extreme drop and long tail.

For 99.9% of the App Store, this is the reality.
