Ever since I moved out to [California](/2012/07/08/california.html), my parents have come out for Christmas.   I know, I know, this is only the second year, but we're off to a great start.  Last I was living in Carlsbad, so we just hung out around the village, and popped down to San Diego a few times.  But, this year we decided to do something different and meet up in San Francisco.  I jumped at the idea.

I've been in love with San Francisco ever since I first stepped out of the Embarcadero BART Station.  I still don't know what it is about the city that captured my imagination.  If I knew, I think the mystique would be lost, and that would be the end of my love affair.  But I digress.

It was a fantastic trip.  I drove up on the Saturday before Christmas.  Traffic was terrible from Los Angeles all the way to my turn off at highway 152.  Our hotel was south of the city in Burlingame.  Just a short shuttle ride to SFO and we were on the BART.  If you're trying to visit San Francisco on a budget, or just think spending $80 a night for a hotel is much better than $250, then staying down by the airport is probably for you.  I wouldn't suggest it if you're attending a conference, but if your plan includes the words, "whenever we get up" the airport is the place for you.

We spent the first day in the city, walking around Fisherman's Wharf.  We headed over to Blue Bottle coffee for a late afternoon caffein fix.  We wanted to get back to the hotel before it got to late, so we hopped onto the BART and headed back to SFO.  On a side note, if you're ever in the Millbrae area, go eat at [Ben Tre](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-tre-vietnamese-homestyle-cuisine-millbrae).  They don't speak much english, but that's half the fun.

The next day we all loaded up in the car and headed down to the valley.  A quick stop at the [Mothership](http://www.apple.com/companystore/), then we headed to the [Intel museum](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/intel-museum.html).  I wasn't quite sure what the parents would think, but they seemed to enjoy it.  Intel wasn't the only museum stop.

Tuesday we headed back into the city and headed to the [de Young](http://deyoung.famsf.org) to check out the ["iPad artist"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hoackney) my parents had been told about.  It was not what we were expecting.  One thing we learned, don't blindly trust an employee of a museum if they tell you an exhibit is __awesome__.  Long story short, it wasn't great.  The experience at the de Young is probably the only less than stellar activity.

While we did plenty of walking, our primary modes of transportation around the city, other than BART was [Uber](https://www.uber.com).  Uber, while kinda pricy, is by far the easiest and best experience for getting from point A to point B on short notice.  It allowed us to remain flexible with our plans and we didn't have to contently be checking public transportation schedules.  If you're up in San Francisco and want to give Uber a try, use promo-code __syfsh__.  It'll get you $10 off and hook me up with $10 credit as well. `/end-selfless-plug`

We began the drive back to San Diego Christmas morning and got as far as [San Luis Obispo](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=San+Luis+Obispo).  Thursday we hopped back in the car and kept heading south.  Normally I would just take the 5 all the way to San Diego, but because we were in no rush, Highway 1 was the main route down the coast.

Overall it was a fantastic, although short trip.

On a side note, if you ever find yourself about to drive down County Road G16 (marked as Carmel Valley Rd in Apple maps), re-think your decision.  It's a very beautiful drive, but if you've got anyone that can get motion sick, it will take _forever_ to get down the road.
