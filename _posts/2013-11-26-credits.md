I haven't always been a coder.  *Many moons* ago I chased the dark arts of independent film and video production.  It was a great time, and looking back I'm very happy I got into it.

But film is very expensive hobby/career.  Camera, lights, sound, actors, editing rigs.  It's not an easy thing to crack into as a high schooler.  But I was giving it my everything.  It took years, but a friend of mine ([Casey Crowdis](https://twitter.com/QuietSight)) had a great idea for a short so we went out and made it.

It wasn't long, 3 minutes.  But it was ours, and I couldn't be happier with it.  We entered it into a couple film festivals, and even got accepted into one.  Man, what a great feeling.  Sitting in a dark theatre with a bunch of people about to watch something you've created.  The first time the crowd laughed, I was ecstatic.  I got chills sitting in that room. Getting real time feedback that people that aren't your parents enjoy something you've created is a fantastic feeling.

We didn't win anything but out film was accepted to a festival, and that came with a perk I wasn't expecting.  It was registered with [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504240/).  So until the end of time, or at least until IMDB shuts down, [I've got some credits](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3569946/).  

[How To Open a Straw is available to view on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0veSVnGXMCQ) and I dare say it's life changing.

I know this was kinda a shameless plug but it's something I'm proud of, and HTOaS marks the beginning of the end of my illustrious career in the film industry of Oklahoma.
