It's been 118 days, or just shy of 4 months since Apple unveiled the iPhone 5s and the 64bit A7.  At first I didn't know what having a 64bit chip would entail for me as a developer.  But now almost 4 months in, I can almost say unequivocally, it's been me hitting refresh on stupid analytics SDK download page and running `file` on the library.  That's the only difference.

Sure, there are some changes but for the most part, it's just stuff that was wrong to begin with.  Don't try and stick a `long` into a string with `%d`.  That was wrong before, but it worked because on 32bit a `long` is 4 bytes.  But on a 64bit device a `long` is 8 bytes so everything breaks.  Good coding practices would prevent this and for the most part, there wasn't any problems when I switched the apps over to include a 64bit binary.

But, that brings us to 3rd party static libraries.  To me, it seems like 3rd party library, especially analytics, just don't want to add 64bit support.  If your kinda scum-baggy SDK makes me even have .5 seconds of trouble getting something to build/work the way I want, it's gone.  There is no excuse to hold all of your customers back because you want to support iOS 4.

All of that to say, are there any halfway decent analytics that support ~1,000,000 users per month and don't ask for the blood of your first born each month?
