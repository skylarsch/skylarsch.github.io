Facebook has landed in the news again with the [$2 billion purchase][1] of [Oculus][2].  I think VR is the future of gaming.  Oculus got things going, [Sony is jumping on board with Project Morpheus][3] and I wouldn't be surprised to see Microsoft throw their hat into the ring.  Gaming is where VR will develop and social is where it will thrive.

Having a _face to face_ conversation with someone on the other side of the world will be huge.  But I think we're a long way away from this.  The technology is getting there and Oculus is the only game in town right now.  But why would Facebook drop $2 billion on them?

It's a bet that VR will be the future of social.  It's a good move on Facebook's part.  Buying the leader in a new technology before they are to big to be purchased is a huge move.  But it doesn't solve Facebook's biggest problem.

They're not cool anymore.

Facebook's money can solve a lot of problems.  But not being the hot social network is one of them.  I'm not sure VR can do that as well.
