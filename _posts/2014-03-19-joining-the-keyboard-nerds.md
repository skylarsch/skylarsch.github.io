I've recently joined the keyboard nerds.  One of the guys at the office was nice enough to let me borrow one of his mechanical keyboards to try.  After a few days I was hooked, and began shopping around for one of my own.  There were a few requirements.  I didn't want the keyboard to have a number pad, and the arrow keys couldn't be set away from the rest of the keys.

After some shopping I settled on the [Leopold FC 660M][0].

I couldn't be happier with my decision.  The keys have a great feel.  The spacebar and return keys are just a hair chunkier than their alphanumeric counterparts.  The keyboard I was borrowing wasn't printed and it wasn't as big of a deal as I original thought it would be.  This one I ordered is printed, for no other reason than the unprinted where out of stock when I was ordering.

It you're in the market for a new board, I'm going to recommend the Leopold FC 660M.
