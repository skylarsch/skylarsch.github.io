I recently decided to write a side project in [Objective-C instead of Swift][0].  And I'm still happy with that decision.  The project uses quite a bit of some C level libraries, and I'm much more comfortable using C to interact with the C APIs than Swift.

But I'm still very excited about Swift and what it means for iOS and Mac development.  Not long after the announcement at WWDC [Jesse Squires wrote about the speed of Swift][1].  His less than exciting results from the benchmarks threw the devforums into a tizzy.

People were doubting Apple could deliver on the promised speeds of Swift.  Well, with beta 5 it [looks like they have][2].  My interest is peaked yet again.
