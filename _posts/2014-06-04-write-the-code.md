My alarm started blaring at 6AM.  But it didn't matter, I was already wide awake.  It was June 2nd, Apple keynote day.  I had been awake for about an hour.

Two hours later, I was standing in line at Moscone West.

Then the line was moving!  I was in the building, but they were just shuffling us into different lines.

More waiting.  Then, Keynote time!

I wasn't near the front of the room, but I was in the room for one of the best Keynotes I've experienced in years.

[Seriously, go watch it](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2014/)
