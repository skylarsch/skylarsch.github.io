This morning I ran into a little problem with a new iOS project I'm working on.  My first instinct wasn't to go to Google, or Stack Overflow.  Instead I opened [Dash][1], looked up the class I was having troubles with.

I find it interesting that I can solve a vast majority of issues I come across without opening a web-browser.  I think some of that can be attributed to living in a home without internet for a year.  Everything I came up against had to be solved by offline documentation or Googling on my phone.  That year I began to rely heavily on Dash.

I just spent the last few minutes browsing through [Stack Overflow iOS][2].  It's laughable how bad some of the answers are.  And scary how easily I would have taken them as good ideas a year ago.  That's not to say there aren't a few good answers to hard problems.  But you really have to go digging to find those.

For me, I've reached a point in my career where I'm into the documentation stage.  I've got enough expertise to have a good idea what I'm looking for.  And just enough cleverness to work out what needs to be done by reading that documentation.

There will always be a place for Google and sites like Stack Overflow in my workflow.  Programing is to big of a subject ever scratch the surface of.  But the internet is becoming my second option when I run into a problem.
