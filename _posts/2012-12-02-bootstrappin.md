The internet is littered with posts about how you shouldn't use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).  "It's overused" is the primary complaint I hear.  And that's true, it is overused.  Does that mean that I'm not going to use a site build on Bootstrap? No.  If a site serves a purpose, and isn't buggy as crap, I don't care that it looks like 60% of the other startups out there.

I'm stuck in an unusual place. I love good design, I love making products, but I can't design to save my life.  It's not for a lack of trying.  What I see in my head is fantastic, but what is produced on the screen is a semi-completed crapy version of me idea.  I don't know what the deal is, but it sucks.  Enter Bootstrap.

Bootstrap lets me get things up and running, quickly without making me want to stab out my eyeballs.  It's intuitive, well documented and easy to override defaults.  The bundled javascript makes some fairly complicated things pretty simple as well.  This allows me work on adding features, fixing bugs, and testing instead of fighting with Photoshop.  Without Bootstrap I would spend hours inside of PS fighting to create the perfect layout, but instead just a few HTML tags and it's off to the races.

I'm not saying you should just slap a link tag in the head and call it a day.  Each site can have it's own personality.  The personality comes from the interactions with the site itself.  Maybe all of the edit boxes fly in, or each hover state fades in and out.  These little thinks delight the users and provide that little bit extra to their experience.

The functionality of a site gets me there.  The effectiveness (read easy of use and quality/bug freeness) keeps me there.  It's design and personality are just icing on the cake.  You may have the most beautiful button in the world but if the site blows up every time I click on something those shiny buttons don't mean crap.

Please stop polishing you shiny turd, slap some Bootstrap on it and squash some bugs.
