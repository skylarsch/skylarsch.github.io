Ask a lot of people in the startup scene why they do what they do, and I bet the answer would be something like this.  "I want to change the world."  That answer would be worded differently, but if you boil it down they would be quite similar.

When someone say "I want to change the world," people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Marcian Hoff come to mind.  They all created something that did change the world as a whole.  Steve Jobs with Apple and the iPhone, Bill Gates has Microsoft, and Marcian Hoff the microprocessor.

But I don't think you need something as big as the iPhone to change the world.  If you create one thing, that one person finds useful, you have changed the world for that person.  Their live will never be the same having used the product you created.  From their perspective the world will never the the same.

I still think it's a great idea to try and "change the world" in the traditional sense.  Aim high and don't be afraid to fail.  But remember that you're building a product for people, not for the world.  Remember, each person that loves your product is someone who's world you've changed.
