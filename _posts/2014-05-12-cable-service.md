I don't want to sound entitled, but is it too much to ask for some decent customer service from cable companies.

I'll give you a second to regain your composure.  Now that you've cleaned up the laughing coffee spill, let's continue.

I'm fairly convinced this is is how the day of a cable CS agent goes.

###### 8am

Arrive at work, decide how they want to ruin peoples days today.

###### 9am

Get the list of appointments for the day they'll have to cancel.

###### 10am

Take an early lunch

###### 4:45pm

Call you, 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time is supposed to end.  Let you know the tech was overbooked and need to reschedule your 1pm-5pm window to 8am-12pm the next day.

If you can't tell, I spent my afternoon working from home, waiting on a cable guy who never showed up.  I appreciate they could get me _rescheduled_ so quickly, but common.  15 minutes before the __4 HOUR WINDOW__ is over you call?  Are you kidding me?  `/rant`
