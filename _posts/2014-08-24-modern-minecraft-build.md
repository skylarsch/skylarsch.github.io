I'm a huge fan of [Minecraft][0].  I think part of it comes from my love of LEGO growing up.  It's a great creative outlet.  I've been toying with a modern-ish house design for a while, and here it is.

The view of the front is partially obscured by some trees.

Once you make it inside the front gate, it's a quick walk to the front doors.

The 1st floor is completly open the back yard.

The bedroom is on the second floor.

There is a great view of the backyard from the 2nd floor.
