Well, it's over and I'm writing this from my couch. 

This was my first experience at WWDC, and boy was it a good one.  Apple knocked it out of the park.  The evangelism team did a fantastic job putting the week together.

It started off with the best keynote I've ever seen.  And I'm not saying that because I was in the room. `</humble-brag>`

The presenters oozed confidence, and people could tell there was going to be a lot of great stuff.  But, possibly the biggest thing to happen to Apple since the Next acquisition caught everyone off guard.

"What if we had Objective-C without the baggage of C?"  Those words took the air out of the room.  I was expecting Objective-C 3.0.  A huge upgrade, and great new features.  Instead we were given [Swift][1].  No one, [except Siracusa][2], saw it coming.

Apple hasn't been sleeping, they've been building.

I can't believe I was able to be a part of it all.  From the fantastic advice I got in labs, to the outstanding sessions, it was an amazing week.

I'm ready to get back to work and build amazing things.
