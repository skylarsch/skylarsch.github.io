Sitting on my desk right now as I type this…

- Mac Book Pro Retina - $2500

- Apple Thunderbolt Display - $1000

- iPad (3) LTE - $750

- iPhone 4s - $700 (w/o contract)

- iPhone 4 - $700 (w/o contract)

- Elevation Dock - $80

- EarPods - $30

- Bobble head - $15

- Nerf gun - $10

For those of you keeping score at home that's $5785 dollars worth of stuff.  On my computer is thousands of dollars in Adobe software alone.  I hardly use the Adobe crap…  But the internet is going to complain about a $20 Mac app that they'll use every single day!

Stop whining, go buy [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id557168941?mt=12) and support a great developer.
