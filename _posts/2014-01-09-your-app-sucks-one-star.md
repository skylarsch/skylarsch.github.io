There has been a lot going around recently about the App Store review system, and developers asking for reviews.  I come down on the _never ask for a review in a disruptive manner_ side of the fence.  That doesn't mean you can't ask for a review, and I think you should.  Just don't pop a modal alert asking.  Put it in a settings, or other inconspicuous spot.

That said the review system is completely broken.  The App Store reviews have turned into a crappy feature/bug reporting system.

Imagine if you worked in a large office.  A customer send in a letter that said, "Your product is crap, and you're crap".  I have no idea what do with that...  But there is a return address, so I could at least write back to them asking them what was _crap_ about the product.  The App Store review system had devolved into just that, but there is __no__ way to follow up with the customer.

I can't even begin to trouble shoot a bug that was reported with, "THE APP IS BROKEN!"  Okay, mr_FaNTa5tic_76.  I'll get right to fixing the broken app.  I don't know if it's crashing on launch because I forgot to add a simple `nil` check, or if he tried to download 1.4TB of movies into the video app, and there just isn't any more room on the device to store his login credentials.

Then the feature requests.  "This app _would_ be 5 stars, BUT, it doesn't support `{{ option_to_do_thing }}`, and until the developer adds support for it I'm giving the app one star."  How awesome would it be to be able to reply to that person?  "Actually `{{ option_to_do_thing }}` is supported, and has been since version 1.0.  If you weren't too stupid to tap options then you would see your 'requested feature'.  Now give me my stars back!"  Sure, the wording would need to finessed a hair, but that's the general idea.

The best way to get your questions answered, or report a bug is to find a way to contact the developer.  It's not hard, Google can do that for you in a matter of seconds.  Send them an email.  I bet they'll love to hear from you.  Just remember, they are a real human being so treat them like one.

Over all, Apple needs to get their crap together.  Fixing the App Store will take quite a bit of work, and at this point I don't think they could even begin to fix all the problems.  There is some extremely low hanging fruit that they could work on, and greatly improve the quality of the store, and it's ecosystem.
